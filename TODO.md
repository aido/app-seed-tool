# app-sskr-check TODO list

### Todo

- [ ] Add Ledger Stax to list of devices app works on
- [ ] Currently hardcoded to use a k-of-n threshold of 2-of-3. Add flow to set threshold values
- [ ] Save memory by setting the SSKR word buffer (G_bolos_ux_context.sskr_words_buffer) to a sensible size. Maybe just store SSKR Bytewords as shorter two letter minimal Bytewords rather than a 4 letter Byteword plus spaace for each share. Convert minimal ByteWords back to four letter Bytewords just prior to display.
- [ ] Add automated tests
