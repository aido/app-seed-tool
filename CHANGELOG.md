## [1.8.0] - 2024-10-23

### Added

- Add Stax layouts for generating SSKR shares
- Add Stax layouts for checking SSKR shares
- Add Stax layouts for recovering BIP39 phrase
- Add screenshots and animations
- Add demo videos for Stax and Nano S
- Add Stax function tests
- Port to Ledger Flex
- Add Flex function tests

### Fixed

- Some plausible yet wrong mnemonic were deemed valid on NBGL devices
- Merge Nano code
- Improve efficiency of `cx_bn_gf2_n_mul()` for Nano S

## [1.7.4] - 2024-06-20

### Fixed

- Ensure result does not overlap with operands in calls to `cx_bn_gf2_n_mul()`
- Give a warning if a user chooses 1-of-m shares when m > 1
- Use CBOR tag for version 2 `sskr`
- Update restrictions on when a release workflow is triggered

## [1.7.3] - 2024-05-29

### Fixed

- Changed name of 'Generate BIP39' menus to 'Recover BIP39'
- Changed Second Montgomery constant used for `cx_bn_gf2_n_mul()` to a more suitable value
- Improve efficiency of `cx_bn_gf2_n_mul()` for Nano S
- Change cmocka git repo from cryptomilk.org to GitLab

## [1.7.2] - 2024-05-06

### Fixed

- Using Ledger SDK `cx_crc32()` function rather than buggy `cx_crc32_hw()`.
- Fix build with SDK master for Nano S

## [1.7.1] - 2024-04-06

### Changed

- Improve efficiency of SSS `interpolate()` function

## [1.7.0] - 2024-03-03

### Added

- Added detailed documentation for all SSKR and SSS functions

### Changed

- Changed Shamir interpolate function to use `cx_bn_gf2_n_mul()` syscalls
- Changed some function names to be more descriptive
- Reorganised and renamed some of the SSKR and Shamir code

## [1.6.1] - 2024-01-27

### Added

- Added a Release Policy document

### Changed

- Updated version of cmocka used for unit tests
- Updated version of github actions used
- Assert HMAC return values

### Fixed

- Fixed failing Ledger rule enforcer check
- Use `cx_crc32_hw()`
  - Ledger have fixed their buggy implementation of CRC32 so we can start using it again

## [1.6.0] - 2024-01-14

### Added

- Use CX_CHECK macro in `compare_recovery_phrase()`
- Added a `cx_crc32()` function
  - The implementation of `cx_crc32_hw()` on Ledger devices is buggy and produces incorrect CRC32 checks. Ledger are fixing `cx_crc32_hw()` on each device either through SDK or OS updates but until then `cx_crc32()` can be used.

## [1.5.4] - 2023-11-30

### Added

- Added mandatory Ledger embedded application manifest file

### Changed

- Combined BIP39 wordlist and SSKR wordlist unit tests

## [1.5.3] - 2023-11-18

### Added

- Added unit tests for BIP39
- Added unit tests for BIP39 word list and SSKR word list

### Fixed

- Fixed CodeQL warnings about sign check of a bitwise operation
- Fixed issue with restarting input from a previous word on Nano S

## [1.5.2] - 2023-11-15

### Changed

- Save memory by setting the SSKR word buffer to a sensible size
  - There is just enough memory available on Nano S to hold the phrases for 10 shares. Other devices can hold the full 16 shares.
- Tidied up code that sets 'Processing' screen on Nano S devices

### Security

- Changed all Variable Length Arrays to a defined length

### Fixed

- Fix freezing at 'Processing' screen on Nano S devices

## [1.5.1] - 2023-11-09
